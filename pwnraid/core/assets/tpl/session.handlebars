		<dt>What is a session driver?</dt>
		<dd>This allows pwnRaid to maintain state for your application in the stateless environment of the web. It allows pwnRaid to store variables on the server using a variety of storage solutions, and recall these variables on the next page request. pwnRaid currently support:</dd>
		<dd>
			<ul>
				<li>Cookie</li>
				<li>Database</li>
				<li>File</li>
				<li>Memcached</li>
			</ul>
		</dd>
		<dt>Which driver should I pick?</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>It depends on your system, environment and what you've got installed.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Cookie</strong> isn't really recommend, only use this if you for some reason can't use the others.</li>
				<li><strong>Database</strong>: if you're on a shared host and don't want to store session data in the filesystem.</li>
				<li><strong>File</strong>: unless you have a good reason not to, pick this driver.</li>
				<li><strong>Memcached</strong> is only useful if you're load balancing pwnRaid over multiple servers.</li>
			</ul>
